G-Code Helpers and Macros 

G-Code is a clunky old language that is very difficult write more complex behaviors. As I am trying to improve my process reliability and include more Macros and other little helpers that check for dumb mistakes I've decided to share my code here for anyone that wishes to see my technique. Much of this might be obvious to the more experienced machinist or maybe it's poor form and bad practice. Feel free to open issues and give feedback. 

All code is provided under the MIT license. G-Code is not like other software code, it moves big things in the real world and can cause harm to the equipment or people if not done properly. This was written for a Haas Mini Mill with NGC (Next Gen Control) and WIPS (Wireless Intuitive Probing System, or Haas's Renishaw package). Use at your own risk and modifications for your system will most likely be required.
